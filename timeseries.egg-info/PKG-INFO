Description: # Time Series Analysis of Historical Stock Data
        
        This projects aims at analyzing historical stock data to predict future closing price while exhibiting good software engineering practices.
        
        A Recurrent Neural Network, implemented with keras, will be used to predict whether a stock's closing price will be higher or lower than the closing price from the previous day.
        
        A combination of fully connected Dense and LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) Layers are used to build a Sequential Keras model.
        The model implements a Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithm to train the model with a training set consisting of stock data from days that are prior to all of the data points in the test set.
        With Time Series Analysis, a model must be evaluated on its ability to make predictions on data points corresponding to dates after any and all data points in the training set. With this approach, the Recurrent Neural Network is scored on its ability to correctly predict the direction of change in the stock's Adjusted Closing Price.
        
        
        # COMMAND LINE INSTRUCTIONS for a Production Level approach (Linux).
        
        ### 0. Make sure python 3 is installed
              $ python3 --version 
              
        ### 1. Install/upgrage pip 
              $ python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade pip  
              $ pip --version
              
        ### 2a. (option A) Create and activate virtual environment with 'virtualenv'
              Choose Option B if you have already have anaconda installed
              $ python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv
              $ python3.7 -m venv tsenv
                    (if python3.7 is not recognize, follow this tutorial: https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-python-3-7-on-ubuntu-18-04/)ls
              $ source tsenv/bin/activate
              
        ### 2b. (option B - THE BETTER OPTION) Create and activate virtual environment with 'conda'
              $ conda create --name tsenv python=3.7
              $ conda activate ~/anaconda3/envs/tsenv
              
        ### 3. Clone the TimeSeriesAnalysis project repository
              $ git clone https://github.com/AHalarewicz/TimeSeriesAnalysis.git
              
        ### 4. Navigate to the TimeSeriesAnalysis project directory and install project modules 
              $ cd TimeSeriesAnalysis
        
        ### 5. Install project specific environment requirements 
              $ pip install -r requirements.txt
              
        ### 6. Install project modules
              $ pip install -e .
              
        ### 7. Download historical stock data specific for the provided ticker.
              $ fetch_raw_data --ticker JPM
        
           Several other ticker symbols that work well with the model include [GE, XOM, BA, GOOG]
        
        ### 8. Prepare the data and format for Time Series Analysis.
              $ format_timeseries
        
        ### 9. Train the Recurrent Neural Network and predict tomorrow's change
              $ predict_tomorrow
        
        Prediction will provided the expected change in price and insight about whether to Buy or Sell
        
        # Makefile for a quick and easy prediction on J.P. Morgan's stock ('JPM')
        ### To run all of the steps sequentially, simply run the make file.
              $ make prediction    
        
        This will: Install requirements > Download and Format data > Train the model > Make Predictions     
        
        
        # Jupyter Notebooks
        ## To execute code line by line, explore the jupyter notebooks
        ### 1. Fetch raw data with yfinance from yahoo finance:
              $ python 3
              >>> import yfinance as yf
              >>> import pandas as pd
              >>> data = yf.download("GOOG", start="2004-08-19", end="2020-04-17")
              >>> data.to_csv('../data/raw/raw.csv')
              >>> quit()
              
        ### 2. Wrangle data and Format for Time Series Predictions with a Recurrent Neural Network
              $ jupyter notebook
        
        NAVIGATE TO: notebooks/data_wranglic.ipynb
              
        ### 3. Build, Train, and score RNN. The model will predict tomorrow's change in price and advise whether to Buy or Sell
              $ jupyer notebook
        
        NAVIGATE TO: notebooks/LSTM_predictions.ipynb
